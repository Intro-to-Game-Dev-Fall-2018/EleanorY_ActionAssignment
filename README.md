### Freeway Clone Game
[Ver1.1_20180916](https://jiaxi-yang.itch.io/freeway-clone)

    What I have so far: 
    
     - 2 Players that can move and collide with cars;</br>
     - Scores; </br>
     - 11 Car prefabs with some crappy sprites; </br>
     - 3 Levels; </br>

    Instruction: </br>
     - Press 1 to swap levels; </br>
     - Press 2 to start game; </br>
     - W/S for Player 1 to move. ↑/↓ for Player 2 to move. </br>
